---------------------------PayXpert, The Payroll Management System------------------------------------------
Instructions:
• Submitting assignments should be a single file or through git hub link shared with trainer and
hexavarsity.
• Each assignment builds upon the previous one, and by the end, you will have a comprehensive
application implemented in Java/C#/Python with a strong focus on SQL schema design, control
flow statements, loops, arrays, collections, and database interaction.
• Follow object-oriented principles throughout the Java programming assignments. Use classes
and objects to model real-world entities, encapsulate data and behavior, and ensure code
reusability.
• Throw user defined exception from method and handle in the main method.
• The following Directory structure is to be followed in the application.
o entity/model
▪ Create entity classes in this package. All entity class should not have any
business logic.
o dao
▪ Create Service Provider interface/abstract class to showcase functionalities.
▪ Create the implementation class for the above interface/abstract class with db
interaction.
o exception
▪ Create user defined exceptions in this package and handle exceptions whenever
needed.
o util
▪ Create a DBPropertyUtil class with a static function which takes property file
name as parameter and returns connection string.
▪ Create a DBConnUtil class which holds static method which takes connection
string as parameter file and returns connection object.
o main
▪ Create a class MainModule and demonstrate the functionalities in a menu
driven application.

Connect your application to the SQL database:
• Create a connection string that includes the necessary information to connect to your SQL Server
database. This includes the server name, database name, authentication credentials, and any
other relevant settings.
• Use the SqlConnection class to establish a connection to the SQL Server database.
• Once the connection is open, you can use the SqlCommand class to execute SQL queries.


Custom Exceptions:
EmployeeNotFoundException:
• Thrown when attempting to access or perform operations on a non-existing employee.
PayrollGenerationException:
• Thrown when there is an issue with generating payroll for an employee.
TaxCalculationException:
• Thrown when there is an error in calculating taxes for an employee.
FinancialRecordException:
• Thrown when there is an issue with financial record management.
InvalidInputException:
• Thrown when input data doesn't meet the required criteria.
DatabaseConnectionException:
• Thrown when there is a problem establishing or maintaining a connection with the database.
Unit Testing:
Create NUnit test cases for car rental System are essential to ensure the correctness and
reliability of your system. Below are some example questions to guide the creation of NUnit test
cases for various components of the system:


Test Case: CalculateGrossSalaryForEmployee
• Objective: Verify that the system correctly calculates the gross salary for an employee.

Test Case: CalculateNetSalaryAfterDeductions
• Objective: Ensure that the system accurately calculates the net salary after deductions (taxes,
insurance, etc.).
Test Case: VerifyTaxCalculationForHighIncomeEmployee
• Objective: Test the system's ability to calculate taxes for a high-income employee.
Test Case: ProcessPayrollForMultipleEmployees
• Objective: Test the end-to-end payroll processing for a batch of employees.
Test Case: VerifyErrorHandlingForInvalidEmployeeData
• Objective: Ensure the system handles invalid input data gracefully.
